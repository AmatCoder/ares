#  VRAM results in the image being stretched in hardware,
#  which is generally much faster, and automatically adds
#  bilinear filtering (if the card supports it).
#
#  However, some video cards end up taking a major speed
#  loss when this option is enabled. It is also the only
#  way to guarantee that the output image will not be
#  filtered.
